> Parallax miner with OpenCL and stratum support

**Hashwarp** is a Parallax GPU miner: with Hashwarp you can mine Parallax which relies on the XHash Proof of Work algorithm. Hashwarp is a fork of Ethminer which originates from [cpp-ethereum] project (where GPU mining has been discontinued) and builds on the improvements made in [Genoil's fork]. See [FAQ](#faq) for more details.

## Features

* OpenCL mining
* Nvidia CUDA mining
* realistic benchmarking against arbitrary epoch/DAG/blocknumber
* on-GPU DAG generation (no more DAG files on disk)
* stratum mining without proxy
* OpenCL devices picking
* farm failover (getwork + stratum)

## Usage

The **hashwarp** is a command line program. This means you launch it either
from a Windows command prompt or Linux console, or create shortcuts to
predefined command lines using a Linux Bash script or Windows batch/cmd file.
For a full list of available command, please run:

```sh
hashwarp --help
```

### Examples connecting to pools

## Build

### Continuous Integration and development builds

| CI            | OS            | Status  | Development builds |
| ------------- | ------------- | -----   | -----------------  |
| [AppVeyor]    | Windows, Linux | [![AppVeyor](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/microstack-tech/hashwarp/main.svg)][AppVeyor] | âœ“ Build artifacts available for the `main` branch |

The AppVeyor system automatically builds a Windows .exe and a Linux binary for every commit in the `main` branch. The latest version is always available [on the landing page](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/microstack-tech/hashwarp) or you can [browse the history](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/microstack-tech/hashwarp/history) to access previous builds.

To download the .exe on a build under `Job name` select the CUDA version you use, choose `Artifacts` then download the zip file.

### Building from source

See [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md) for build/compilation details.
